# CustomDirectivesPractice

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.1.

## Description

My first run in with custom directives in angular. 
I wanted to practice creating an attribute directive which will prevent the user from entering anything but numbers into a text input field.
